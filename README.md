This repo contains the codebook, r script and data.txt file tht fulfills the requirements of the coursera data cleansing programming assignment from week 4 of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

The codebook describes the r script ("run_analysis.r"), I provided both the .md and .html version of the codebook
